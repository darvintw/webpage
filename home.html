            <p>
            Hi, my name is Chia-Min Wei.
            I studied math and economics at National Taiwan University.
            I am joining the Econ PhD program at UW-Madison this fall.
            Here is my <a> CV</a>.

            <h2> Probability & Statistics </h1>
                <ol>
                    <li> <a>Sufficient Statistics</a>: 
                        Introduces the definition of sufficient statistics
                        and minimal sufficient statistics,
                        Sufficiency Principle and Fisher's thought experiment. </li>
                    <li> <a>Martingale</a>: 
                        Introduces the basic definitions of martingale theory, 
                        several real life examples, 
                        and the convergence of martingale. </li>  
                    <li> <a>Three Proofs for CLT</a>: 
                        Introduces three different proofs for the Central Limit Theorem: 
                        De'Moivre's proof, Lindeberg's proof and Charles Stein's proof. </li>
                    <li> <a>Martingale and Harmonic Functions</a>:
                        Introduces the connection between martingale and harmonic functions.
                        The fact that any nonnegative super-harmonic function defined 
                        on R and R^2 must be constant can be proved using martingale theory. </li>
                    <li> <a>Statistical Distances</a>: Introduces several commonly used statistical 
                        distances, such as total variance, Hellinger distance and 
                        KL divergence. </li>
                </ol>
                <h2> Econometrics </h1>
                <ol>
                    <li> <a> E[XX'] and E[XZ'] full rank?</a>: In econometrics, one often encounter 
                        the assumption that E[XX'] / E[XZ'] is full rank.
                        This note introduces the meaning of such assumptions.
                    </li>
